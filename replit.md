# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture. The application uses a single-page application (SPA) pattern with client-side routing handled by Wouter. The UI is constructed with shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, providing accessible and customizable interface elements.

**Key Frontend Technologies:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- TanStack Query for server state management and data fetching
- React Hook Form with Zod validation for form handling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom CSS variables

**Component Structure:**
The application follows a modular component structure with reusable UI components in `/components/ui/` and page-specific components organized by feature. Each major section (Hero, About, Services, Portfolio, etc.) is implemented as a separate component for maintainability.

## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a Node.js/Express.js architecture with TypeScript, implementing a RESTful API pattern. The server uses middleware for request logging, JSON parsing, and error handling. The application is configured for both development and production environments with Vite integration for development mode.

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints for contact form submission (`POST /api/contact`)
- Admin endpoints for retrieving contact messages (`GET /api/contact`)
- Structured error handling with consistent JSON responses
- Request/response logging middleware for debugging

**Data Validation:**
Server-side validation is implemented using Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend, ensuring type safety and consistent data validation across the application.

## Data Storage Solutions

The application uses a dual storage approach with PostgreSQL as the primary database and an in-memory storage fallback for development. Database operations are managed through Drizzle ORM, providing type-safe database queries and schema management.

**Database Schema:**
- `users` table for basic user management (currently for future auth implementation)
- `contact_messages` table for storing form submissions with fields for name, email, service type, and message content
- UUID-based primary keys generated at the database level
- Timestamp tracking for message creation

**ORM Configuration:**
Drizzle ORM is configured with PostgreSQL dialect, supporting both development and production database environments through environment-based configuration.

## External Dependencies

**Core Framework Dependencies:**
- Express.js for server framework
- React ecosystem (React DOM, React Router via Wouter)
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- TypeScript for type safety across the stack

**Database & ORM:**
- Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL for cloud database hosting
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Drizzle Kit for database migrations and schema management

**UI & Styling:**
- Radix UI primitives for accessible component foundations
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Lucide React for consistent iconography
- Font Awesome for additional icon support

**Form & Validation:**
- React Hook Form for performant form handling
- Zod for schema validation and type inference
- TanStack Query for server state management

**Development Tools:**
- Replit-specific plugins for development environment integration
- ESBuild for production bundling
- PostCSS with Autoprefixer for CSS processing

**External Service Integrations:**
The application is designed to integrate with:
- Hostinger for web hosting and domain management
- Formspree for simple, reliable contact form handling
- Zapier for email/SMS automation and workflow integration
- Third-party APIs for enhanced functionality (payment processing, analytics)
